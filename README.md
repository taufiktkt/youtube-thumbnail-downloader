💡 Pro Tip: YouTube thumbnails follow predictable URL patterns. For any video ID (the v= parameter in URLs), you can access thumbnails directly at:

Default: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/default.jpg

HQ: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/hqdefault.jpg

Max Res: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg

This tool simply makes the process foolproof and user-friendly!
